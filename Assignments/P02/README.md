## P02 - Linear Search with Json and Getch
### Carlos Polanco
### Description:

This program finds words in a json file called dictionary. As the name of the file states,
it is a dictionary. The program uses getch in order to get the character the user types. When 
the user types something, different words will show up based on the letter or letters they type. 
This is done by performing a linear search on the json file to find the words the user is typing.

| :---: | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | main.cpp         | Main driver of my project.                         |
|   2   | console.hpp      | determines if running on windows or linux          |
|   3   | json.hpp         | used for json file/object                          |
|   4   | dictionary.json  | json file used for words                           |
|   5   | myPartInMain     | code I added to original program                   |

### Instructions
- Before starting anything, the program does not work well on windows. Use WSL or Replit. 
- Make sure you download the files in the table above.
- When running, type any word to see results.
- If you want to see the definition of what you typed, type a semicolon (does not necessarily
  have to be a full word. Some letters like 'a' have definitions)
- If you type a word and theres only one result, press enter to see its definition.
- To stop the program, type a capital z.
