## P01/EC1 - Vector Class
### Carlos Polanco
### Description:

This program implements a class whose purpose is to use a linked list
as a vector. It has the methods of a linked list used to 
add(push) and remove(pop) items. It can add values to the front, 
middle and rear of the list. Same with removing values. Values can be
removed from the front, middle and rear. Values can be entered in at 
a specific location(index) in the list and values can be removed from 
a certain location.

### Instructions
- Create multiple objects and test every operation. Or just create one and test with that.  
- Try inserting, removing, inserting to the front, removing from the front, etc. 
- It's just a doubly linked list that works as a vector. 
- input.dat is just the input I used for my tests, and test.out is my output file. No need to use mine, you can create your own.
